%	D : a PRTools dataset structure. It can be obtained from a (X,Y) couple
%		of matrices thanks to a call to 'prdataset(X,Y)'. in this case, X 
%		is a matrix with each line corresponding to an input data point, 
%		and Y is a vector with the corresponding outputs (true classes)
%
%	tree : the root node of the decision tree. This node structure may 
%		represents an splitting node or a leaf node.
%		if a leaf node, contains 2 fields:
%			.split: a 'fake' splitting rule with a negative feature index
%			.proba: the a posteriori probabilities
%		if an internal node, contains 3 fields:
%			.split: the splitting rule returned by the randFeatSelection func
%			.left: the left node (recursive call)	
%			.right: the right node (recursive call)
